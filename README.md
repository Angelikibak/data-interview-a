# Interview tasks

> The repository contains a collection of tasks for candidates.

Tasks are in `tasks.R`. All required data is contained in this repository.
Please fork the repository to solve the tasks.

Technically, it is possible to solve all the tasks with the provided
packages such that no additional packages must be loaded. However, you can
use additional packages if you want with one exception: Do not use the `sp` but
only the `sf` package for spatial manipulations.
