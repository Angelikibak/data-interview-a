# Interview tasks

> The repository contains a collection of tasks for candidates.

Tasks are in `tasks.R`. All required data is contained in this repository.
Technically, it is possible to solve all the tasks with the provided
packages such that no additional packages must be loaded. However, you can
use additional packages. There is one exception: Please, do not use the `sp`
package, as it is outdated and slow,
but only the `sf` package for spatial manipulations.

The tasks have different levels of difficulty. Task 3 is the most difficult.
Please proceed with the tasks in the given order: Start with 1, continue with 2,
etc.

Please fork the repository to solve the tasks. After the fork, you have
around **2 hours** to solve the tasks. Please commit
and push solutions to your fork
with a reasonable frequency. For instance, do not wait for the full time
for the first commit. Better: After, for instance, solving task 1, commit
and push the solution, and so on. Commits after the 2 hours mark will be
ignored.
